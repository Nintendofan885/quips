Quips server
============

A bash.org inspired quips server.

When Wikimedia used Bugzilla as its issue tracker, we also used the quips
functionality to store funny quotes from irc, bug reports, code reviews and
other sources. Since we have moved to Phabricator, this functionality has been
missed. This app attempts to bring joy back to the masses by allowing access
to the former quips dataset that is now stored in an Elasticsearch index.
